      <description>For quite some while ago, actually the very beginning of playing fingerstyle(or kinda) I&#39;ve heard an impressive song which means till today a lot to me. It&#39;s an catchy tune with an easy but at the same time unique melody. I think there is for all of us only a few songs which we like to listen to even after years. For me Windy and Warm is definitely one of those.</description>
